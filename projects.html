          In this project, we created a pipeline to create a documented 3d model from historical data.
          I developed a web-interface to interact and edit the 3d model.
          It allows to changes attributes (e.g. roof slope) and relaunch the procedural modelling of the city.

          The <a href="https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/fr/articles/002440/2014-08-07/" target="_blank">Historical Dictionary of Switzerland (HDS)</a> is a fascinating source on Swiss history.
          Started in the 1980s as a paper-based encyclopedia, it was made without hyperlinks.<!--, which are today an expectation of our browsing experience.-->
          With this project, I scraped the HDS's 36'000 articles, used a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to recognize entities in the text and add hyperlinks to their corresponding HDS and Wikipedia articles.
          <!--Finally I brought it back online as a standalone website,--> The linked HDS now offers a much more modern and intuitive exploration experience.

          With the parcels of Venice project, the DHLAB is digitizing historical cadastral data for Venice: maps of parcels with their accompanying metadata (owners, rent, etc)
          As part of the Parcels of Venice project, I developed a platform to explore spatio-temporal cadastral registries.
          It allows to view parcels, their owner and metadata. Moreover, I supervised a student to perform named entity recognition
          on the 23'000 entries and disambiguate unique persons and link them to the parcels they own.

          This proof-of-concept personal nutrition data-vizualisation is a demo built for a nutrition
          research project where participants collect data on their food consumption. 
          The interactive visualization allows participants to compare their nutrient intakes across food

          For my Master thesis, I used long-run wealth distribution and mortality data to reconstruct the distribution of bequest from 1934 to 2013 in a selection of Swiss cantons. The resulting time series shows that the distribution of bequests is less unequal that it was 80 years ago thanks to the rise of the upper middle class.
