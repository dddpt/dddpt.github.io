        <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Direct-to-consumer genetic testing services such as 23andMe or AncestryDNA have already attracted 26 million customers.
        These services raise privacy concerns, as some people share their genomic data publicly on platforms such as GEDmatch. 
        Notably, sensitive information on health outcomes can be deduced not only on the tested person, but also on their close relatives.
        In this paper, we present KGP Meter, a new online tool that provides means for raising awareness in the general public about the privacy risks of genomic data sharing.
